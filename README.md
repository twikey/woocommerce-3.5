> We offer you the "payment building blocks" for constructing your own cheap payment gateway.

### Gateway selection

You can decide which gateway to use (based on the items in the cart) by adding the filter 'twikey_gateway_selection'
The outcome should either be 'twikey' for Direct debit or 'twikey-paylink' in case you want to use a payment link.
eg.

```$php
    // For hoodies we use direct debit as they are returning customers :)
    public function selectGatewayBasedOnCart($cart){
        // Loop through all products in the Cart
        foreach ($cart as $cart_item_key => $cart_item) {
            $productId = $cart_item['product_id'];
            $term_list = wp_get_post_terms($productId, 'product_cat');
            // SELF::log("$term_list = ".print_r($term_list,true),WC_Log_Levels::NOTICE);
            $cat = $term_list[0] -> slug;
            if ($cat === 'hoodies') {
                // SELF::log("CARD = $cat -> ".print_r($isCard,true));
                return 'twikey';
            }
        }
        return 'twikey-paylink';
    }
    add_filter('twikey_gateway_selection', array( $this, 'selectGatewayBasedOnCart') );
```

### Template selection

You can decide which template to use (based on the items in the order) by adding the filter 'twikey_template_selection'
The outcome should be a template id.
eg.

```$php
    // For hoodies we use direct debit as they are returning customers :)
    public function selectCtBasedOnOrder($order){
        if($order->get_billing_country() === 'BE')
            return 123;
        return 321;
    }
    add_filter('twikey_template_selection', array( $this, 'selectCtBasedOnOrder') );
```
